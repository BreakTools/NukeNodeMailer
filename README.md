## Node mailer allows you to...
- ...send node setups to other users on the local network.
- ...store received node setups so you can import them again later.
- ...enjoy the refreshing nostalgia of Windows 95.

## Mailing
Nodes can be mailed to other users who've got Node Mailer installed. Users are auto-discovered on the local network so no server, database or shared file system is required!
